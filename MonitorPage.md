Data Science Application Development Service Monitor
====================================================

To assist those using our services we now have a monitoring page that will report service failures. The page shows the results of our service monitor which tests all of our services in both test and production every minute.

The reporting on this is light, however it will still report information about the failure:

1. response message from server
2. HTTP response code
3. The call which the service failed on.
